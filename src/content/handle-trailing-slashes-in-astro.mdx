When working with Next.js, handling trailing slashes is seamless. If you visit a page with a trailing slash, Next.js automatically redirects you to the same page without it. This is great for SEO and user experience, keeping URLs consistent.

However, in Astro, things work a bit differently. If you set trailingSlash: "never" in astro.config.mjs, Astro ensures that URLs wonâ€™t end with a trailing slash. But thereâ€™s a catchâ€”if a user manually visits a page with a trailing slash, Astro wonâ€™t automatically redirect them to the non-trailing version.

For those using Vercel, this issue is easy to fix. You can simply create a vercel.json file at the root of your project with the following content:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/:path+/",
      "destination": "/:path+"
    }
  ]
}
```

But I donâ€™t use Vercel for my project, so I needed a different approach. I didnâ€™t want to manually define rewrites or redirects for every pageâ€”I wanted a global solution.

I searched for answers, even asked AI for help, but nothing really solved the problem. Then, I went back to the Astro documentation and realized something: I could use middleware to handle this! Surprisingly, when I asked on Discord, no one suggested thisâ€”they only told me to configure it in Nginx, which wasnâ€™t an option for me.

So, I wrote this middleware to globally remove trailing slashes:


```typescript

import { defineMiddleware } from "astro:middleware"

export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(({ url, redirect }, next) => {
  const pathname = url.pathname

  if (pathname.length > 1 && pathname.endsWith("/")) {
    return redirect(pathname.slice(0, -1), 301)
  }

  return next()
})

```

Now, whenever a user visits a page with a trailing slash, they get redirected to the proper URLâ€”no extra configurations, no manual rewrites, just a clean, automatic fix.

But, If you prefer URLs with trailing slashes, you can modify the middleware like this:

```typescript

export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(({ url, redirect }, next) => {
  const pathname = url.pathname

  if (!pathname.endsWith("/") && !pathname.includes(".")) {
    return redirect(`${pathname}/`, 301)
  }

  return next()
})
````

Thatâ€™s it! Just a small tweak to the logic, and your middleware will handle trailing slashes globally. ðŸš€
